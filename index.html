                  Identified main causes of tire mold reorders. Based on this data, performed a close the loop analysis to test the Residual Self-Aligning Torque (RSAT) prediction capability. Analyzed as-built geometry and tread pattern to run prediction of RSAT, used Catia and Goodyear FEA tools. Analyzed resulting data to determine trends in predictive capability, factors that impact RSAT, and suggestions for improving both the predicting tool and process.

                  <p>
                    This design project took place over the course of 8 weeks and consisted of a final public competition, an in-class oral presentation, and a thorough documentation package. Worked in a team setting to design, construct, code, and document an autonomous robot to complete several “pit crew” tasks on a course. These tasks included, detecting a light color to start the robot, pushing buttons, flipping a switch, picking up and dropping off a wrench, and turning a fuel crank 180 degrees in a certain direction. My main responsibility was to construct the chassis, compose the technical drawings and solidworks models, and run most of the trial tests and make corresponding adjustments in preparation for the final competition. The robot was controlled using the proteus, a controller that uses Qt Creator and allows the robot to be programmed in C++, and parts were bought through Ohio State with a budget of $160.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The robot went through several design iterations, but the final design was constructed using two IGWAN motors, two DuBro wheels with rubber bands, and two skids in the front using dowel rods and regular plastic spoons. This proved to provide the best mobility and accuracy by reducing friction.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The robot used several types of sensors. A CdS sensor was used to detect the color of the start light and the button board light on the course. A 3D printed cone was used to secure the CdS cell underneath the chassis. Red filter paper covered the opening of the cone as this color filter read the greatest difference in light intensity this is shown below.
                  </p>
                  <img
                    class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto"

                    alt="..."
                  />
                  <p>
                    To use RPS, which reads the location of the robot, a QR code was placed onto a piece of PVC directly above the chassis of the robot secured with two erector pieces that extended from either side of the robot. This aided the robot with precise turning and distance driving during the competition. The shaft encoders, which determine the distance traveled by the robot, were built into the IGWAN motors, and these were used for driving and turning certain distances. This was the main form of navigation used, and it proved to be quite reliable during the performance tests, individual competition, and final competition.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The two main features on the robot that were used to complete tasks on the course were the U-arm and the hinged arm. Overall, these two designs proved to be quite consistent and reliable in performance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The U-arm was located in the front of the robot. It had the main task of turning a fuel crank on the course by inserting its prongs into the holes on the fuel crank and turning either clockwise or counterclockwise. The base was constructed out of a piece of PVC and axles were attached with a Futaba motor as shown below.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The hinged arm was located in the back of the robot. It had the task of flipping the jack by driving underneath as well as picking up the wrench and depositing the wrench. The arm was constructed using a dowel rod and two axles, and attaching one side to a FITEC servo motor using hot glue. The hinged arm is shown below.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    During the final competition, the robot performed well and completed most of the required tasks, receiving a final score of 72/100. The tasks that were not completed were due to errors with detections in the RPS. The tournament took place in a different location compared to the practice runs and this impacted the sensitivity of the positioning system. Using push buttons on the sides of the robot to trigger turning would have significantly reduced the dependency on the positioning system. With more time, using a four-wheel four motor drive would increase control and accuracy and this may have led to more accurate turning and distance driving. Finally, with four motors, the robot would have been able to do point turns, which could have increased the speed of the robot.

                    There are two basic parts to this prototype. The “display” present on the outside of the door and the “detector” present on the inside of the door. The detector part contains the photoresistor, which detects whether the light inside the room is on, indicating the presence of an RA, or whether the light inside the room is turned off, indicating the absence of an RA. The display part contains an RGB LED, a passive buzzer, a pushbutton that functions as a doorbell, a servo motor with an attachment that can cover or uncover the pushbutton doorbell, an LCD display that communicates whether an RA is present is inside the room, and a potentiometer that contains the intensity of the text on the LCD Screen. If the presence of an RA is detected using the photoresistor, on the display part, the RGB LED turns green, the servo motor moves the covering to reveal the pushbutton doorbell, and the LCD Display displays the text “I’m Free!”. When the doorbell is pressed, the passive buzzer emits a buzzing sound for 2 seconds. If the absence of an RA is detected, on the display part, the RGB LED turns red, the servo motor covers up the pushbutton doorbell, and the LCD Display displays the text “Do Not Disturb”. If the doorbell is still pressed somehow while being covered up, the buzzer still doesn’t get activated. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Additionally, I have a LED and pushbutton component attached to the “detector” part that is placed inside of the room to function as a manual override when the light is turned off/dimmed inside of the room. When this pushbutton is pressed, the LED, which is located right next to photoresistor, turns on. This makes the photoresistor send a signal that the RA is present in the room to the “display” part of the prototype. This results in the RGB LED turning green, the servo motor arm uncovering the doorbell, and the LCD Display Screen displaying “I’m Free!”.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As far as the function of the actual programming behind this prototype, I had each component in a separate function. These functions were called depending on the status of the photoresistor, which was checked at the beginning of the program. These functions included one for the LCD Display, the RGB LED, and the Servo Motor function. If the light was detected by the photoresistor, an additional function that activated the pushbutton door and passive buzzer system was called as well. The final prototype and circuit schematic is shown below.

                    Purpose of this project was to design and analyze an airfoil to construct a functioning aircraft. Worked in a team where my responsibility was to mesh the selected airfoil in ANSYS Fluent and run all simulations through CFD analysis to obtain corresponding lift and drag coefficients. The Boeing 747-400 was selected for analysis and values for the dimensions of the plane, weight, cruising altitude, and estimating Reynolds number at the altitude were obtained for future calculations. Based on the Boeing 747-400, the BOEING BACXXX AIRFOIL was selected for analysis.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Airfoil coordinates for the BOEING BACXXX Airfoil were imported from airfoiltools.com. The airfoil was then meshed and simulations were run at angles of attack for 0,3, and 5 degrees. Simulations were first run for inviscid flow and then were run for viscous flow, and the respective drag and lift coefficients were obtained. Pictures below show the airfoil being meshed in a select fluid domain.

                    Using the coefficient of lift & Drag data from these simulations and calculations including Amount of Lift , wing area required, angle of attack required, and drag estimate, and Power Requirement and Propulsion Estimate,the following conclusions were made. The required lift for the designed aircraft was found to be 880,000 lbm. = 27,329 lbf. This value matches the data stated by outside resources on the maximum weight of the Boeing 747-400. The wing area required to lift the load at takeoff was found to be 2161 sq. ft. This value is low when considering the actual wing area of a Boeing 747-400 is around 5000 sq. ft. This can be attributed to an error in choosing the coefficient of lift from the simulation. The angle of attack in cruising conditions was found to be -1.50 degrees. This value certainly will be different in a real aircraft, as it does not logically make sense for an aircraft to cruise with a negative angle of attack. In the event of a negative angle of attack, an aircraft will typically begin descending rather than maintaining altitude. The wingspan, chord, and aspect ratio were found to be 211.0 ft, 10.25 ft, and 20.59, respectively. These values do seem plausible for a real aircraft. The drag force due to the wings was estimated to be 2920.4 lbf. The drag due to the fuselage was estimated to be 40,936.6 lbf. The composite drag force from both of the wings and the fuselage was estimated to be 46777.4 lbf. These results seem plausible for a real aircraft. Based on the calculation of the composite drag, the required power for cruising was found to be 70,727.4 HP. This value was found by utilizing the relationship that power is equal to the product of velocity and drag force. The value is appropriate for a real aircraft. Finally, the consumption of fuel was estimated to be 28,300.3 lbm. of fuel per hour. Based on the calculation for the weight of fuel that can be carried in the 747-400, 57285 lbm. of fuel, the aircraft can hold enough fuel to fly for about 13.5 hours. This value of time is appropriate for a real aircraft, therefore the value for the fuel consumption is appropriate.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Just as many assumptions were made, many sources of error can come from these. The Reynold’s number during takeoff and cruising flight are unlikely to be exactly 1,000,000, but the empirical data sheets did not have Reynold’s numbers higher than this. The calculated angle of attack during cruising flight was found to be a negative value, which conceptually does not make sense, as the aircraft could not maintain a horizontal flight path with the wings angled downward. This error can be associated with the Reynold’s number approximation. Reynold's number during cruising flight can be as high as 75,000,000, which was not available in the data sheets. The weight of the aircraft, its passengers, and luggage aboard are all assumed values based on averages. However, the calculated weight value does seem appropriate when compared to the actual weight of a 747-400 (about 875,000 pounds).

                    I worked on this project during my internship at Goodyear in Summer of 2019. The objective of this project was to analyze the predictive capability of the current RSAT tool used by Goodyear. The current predictive tool did not test the actual tread on the tire, rather a simplified FEA version for testing and this is what caused discrepancies. Factors that impact RSAT were identified along with trends and recommendations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As a precursor, historic mold reorder data was analyzed and RSAT was determined to be the main causes of reordering molds. Therefore, the predictive RSAT tool was identified as a place of improvement.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I used the identified mold reorders that had RSAT as an issue and obtained the RSAT test conditions, target, tested value, and construction package for each reorder. Treads were meshed in CATIA (CAD software similar to solidworks) and run through a Goodyear specific FEA software. Getting a good quality mech was one of the challenges I had, and through this process I realized that changing the tread mesh settings (even treatment codes of different components) impacts RSAT so tests had to be run at a consistent setting. Pictures below show the process of tire meshing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After running each mesh through the FEA tool, I found there to be significant differences between the RSAT values between data collected in both the in house testing center as well as a partner testing center. Along with this, there were significant differences if the tires were Off the Round Tires (I.E. wheels n the Ford Bronco) compared to All-Season Tires.
                  </p>
                  <img
                    class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto"
                    src="assets/img/portfolio/41.png"
                    alt="..."
                  />
                  <p>
                    It would be beneficial to see the effect of tire type on RSAT and perhaps why this difference exists. In the future, implementing a different way to predict RSAT depending on tire type would be beneficial because as stated before, the RSAT predicted for off-roading tires was considerably different from the predictive RSAT data for all season tires. Improving the RSAT tool in general but maybe predicting RSAT in different ways depending on type of tires would as a result provide more accurate results. This would only be possible with more data collected/recovered from off-road tires to see what specifically impacts it. Additionally, it’s important to note that there were currently no recorded trends between tires tested in house vs. at the partner testing center.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I had three recommendations for the current tool. The RSAT Predictive Tool used a slider and a graph to determine the final RSAT value. The problem with this is the variability. The graph is supposed to even out to a value, but there is no consistent way to determine the RSAT value. Regardless of having variability in settings that affect RSAT, this human variability could be eliminated. The mesh quality indicator could also be improved since sometimes running a mesh labeled as “bad quality” ended up with a more accurate RSAT value. Due to this, the effect of the quality detector could be studied. Finally, changes to the baseline and treatment codes both had an effect on RSAT so keeping track of changes for these and keeping them consistent would help obtain more accurate RSAT values.

                    The scope of this project focused on the eaches picking process currently present at Frito-Lay. Currently, convenience stores order custom cases of ‘eaches’ (another name for bags of chips) instead of full cases of eaches. This makes up about 25% of the business and is inefficient due to the manual picking. The proposed automated solution would make this process a lot easier. This automated solution is being piloted and has several key components that feature new and existing technologies that integrate into the current warehouse system.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The very first component of this automated solution involved converting full cases of eaches into order-line quantities, or patterns of eaches as shown below.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The picking and conveyor system of this component was experiencing time delays so my project involved developing a simulation that would quantify these existing time delays and validate a new logic for the equipment that would improve the production rate overall.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The conveyor system consisted of several different parts highlighted below:

                  <img

                  />
                  <p>
                    Time delays occurred on this conveyor system when patterns of eaches consisting of 2 rows or less were produced. The proposed logic change involved converting one of the conveyors into a secondary buffer conveyor to improve the production rate.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I was given the picking rate, accelerations, velocities, and length data of all components, rate limitations as well as order-line quantity specifications. I used these values to develop my simulation using VBA. This tool was used to simulate patterns on the current conveyor system.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     My developmental process is highlighted in these following steps:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      I first developed an outline of a model for a single each travelling through the current conveyor system and printed out time stamps as each conveyor was completed.
                    </li>
                    <img
                    class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto"

                    <li>
                      I then repeated this constant each pattern for an entire sequence as shown to simulate how patterns would travel through the entire conveyor system. This allowed me to calculate & print out the time delays present between each pattern.

                    <li>
                      To model how patterns are actually run through the system, I varied the number of eaches in every pattern along with the total number of patterns. printing out time stamps of every single pattern and the time delays between each one.

                    <li>
                      I then set up the proposed model, which implemented the secondary buffer. This allowed me to compare the time delays, production rates, production times, and individual pattern tims between both the current and proposed system.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Finally, I tested a week's worth of real data to use for my analysis and draw conclusions about the proposed method.
                    </li>
                    <img
                    class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto"
                    src="assets/img/portfolio/fritolay7.png"

                    />
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    In order to validate my simulation before running it through real data, I ran pattern tests with the actual pilot equipment and found there to be a 1.21% difference between tested and simulated. After proving my simulation tool, I then began to test real data.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After running the weeks worth of real data through the current and proposed simulation, I found a 2.81% improvement in production time and a 3.30% improvement in production rate which correlated to an increased output of 9 eaches case per hour.

                  <b>Final Effect of Project:</b>
                  <p>
                    After the success of the simulation results, I proposed this method to our vendors of the equipment who approved the solution and actively worked on implementing the proposed method.
                  </p>
                  <b>Final Thoughts:</b>
                  <p>
                    The VBA simulation tool that I developed is versatile in its use. It can run both real and mockup data. Additionally, all givens and assumptions can be modified for future testing and rate improvement. Finally, this tool includes all skus, or all types of chip bags; therefore, it would generate accurate predictive data when all skus are finally implemented.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The proposed method of using a secondary buffer could be used for future conveyor systems that are developed as well. Therefore, this model saves time down the road & opens the door for other applications that can use this logic (future reassessments).
                  </p>
                  <b>Future Considerations:</b>
                  <p>
                    Currently, different patterns of eaches are arranged based on the order of fulfillment needs. Since the length of patterns affect the rate, it would be interesting to see how adjusting the order in which these patterns come through has an effect on the production rate.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Additionally, adjusting the length of conveyors could also have some effect on the production rate and could be analyzed to see effects on time delays.
